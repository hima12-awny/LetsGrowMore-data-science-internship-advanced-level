# LetsGrowMore-data-science-internship-advanced-level
During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on two exciting projects in the field of machine learning and natural language processing. The first project involved developing a neural network that can accurately recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The second project focused on implementing an LSTM-based language model for next-word prediction, which can improve the performance of various NLP tasks such as sentence completion. Both projects were challenging and rewarding and allowed me to gain valuable experience in developing and training neural networks for real-world applications.

# Handwriting Recognition Neural Network using MNIST
This project involves developing a neural network that can accurately recognize handwritten digits. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The neural network architecture consists of multiple layers of neurons, which are trained using CNN. The trained model can be used to detect handwritten digits in real time in front of the camera.

### Getting Started
To start this project, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Then, run the read_numbers_from_vid_v02.py file to train and test the neural network on the MNIST dataset.

# LSTM-based Next Word Prediction
This project focuses on implementing a language model that can predict the next word in a given sentence using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data, which is preprocessed to generate sequences of words. The LSTM network is then trained to predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous words. The trained model can generate text, autocomplete sentences, and improve the performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

### Getting Started
To start this project, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Then, run the next_word_prediction.ipynb file to train and test the LSTM-based language model on a text corpus.
